                <h2>Ways to stay motivated and succeed</h2>
                <p>"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have
                    to
                    trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut,
                    destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the
                    difference
                    in my life." <span>--Steve Jobs</span></p>

                <h2>Ways to stay motivated and succeed</h2>
                <p>"A man can be as great as he wants to be. If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the
                    determination, the dedication, the competitive drive and if you are willing to sacrifice the little
                    things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done." <span>--Vince

                <h2>Ways to stay motivated and succeed</h2>
                <p>"The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously
                    consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan
                    to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them." <span>--Denis Waitley</span>
